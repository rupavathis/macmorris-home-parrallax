        Early modern Ireland was a site of extraordinary literary vibrancy. The backdrop to this rich 
        cultural landscape was one of political turmoil, conflict and colonial violence. MACMORRIS picks
         up in 1541, when the Irish parliament passed the Act of Kingly title, which declared Henry VIII 
          and his heirs to be the Kings of Ireland, and created the Kingdom of Ireland. What followed was an 
          expansion of English control through the Tudor conquest, led by a series of Lord Deputies such as 
          Anthony St Leger,  Thomas Radclyffe,  William Fitzwilliam  and Henry Sidney.  The conquest involved 
          the confiscation of land from the Gaelic Irish, and policies such as surrender and regrant, whereby 
          Gaelic Lords were encouraged to surrender their lands to the crown and in return for their loyalty 
          and adherence to English customs, they would be regranted the land as freehold and given an English 
          title (see Conn Bacach Ó Néill,  Earl of Tyrone, Muircheartach Ó Briain , Earl of Thomond, and Domhnall 
          Mac Carthaigh Mór,  Earl of Clancar). As part of the conquest, Henry Sidney  established the provincial 
          presidency in Munster, a post that reported directly to the Lord Deputy, but had full authority within 
          the Province. However, this office brought with it its own problems and casualties.
